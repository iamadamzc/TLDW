 the fact that you have over 400 videos is very likely the issue. That's the key piece of information we were missing.

The problem isn't the number of videos itself, but the time it takes to count them. Your code is trying to count all 400+ videos one page at a time (50 videos per API call). This process is likely taking too long, causing the function to hit a timeout limit on the server and fail silently, which results in the 0 count.

This is a good problem to haveâ€”it means you're dealing with real-world data loads.

## Action Plan: Diagnose the Timeout, Then Change the Strategy
We'll do a quick test to prove it's a timeout, and then implement a much better, more efficient strategy.

Step 1: Let's Prove It's a Timeout
We need to see how long the counting process is taking. Let's add simple timers to the code.

Go back to your get_user_playlists function in Replit.

At the very top of your Python file, add import time.

Modify the "Watch Later" try block to look like this, adding the lines marked with # ADD THIS:

Python

        try:
            print("Starting Watch Later count...") # ADD THIS
            start_time = time.time() # ADD THIS
            watch_later_count = 0
            next_page_token = None
            
            while True:
                # ... your request code ...
                response = request.execute()
                # ...
                # ... your counting logic ...
                # ...
                if not next_page_token:
                    break
            
            end_time = time.time() # ADD THIS
            print(f"SUCCESS: Counting finished in {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds.") # ADD THIS
            
            playlists.append({
                'id': 'WL',
                'title': 'Watch Later',
                'video_count': watch_later_count,
                #...
            })

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"ERROR: The process failed. Error: {e}") # ADD THIS
            # ... the rest of your except block ...
Now, run the test one more time and watch the Replit console carefully.

If you see the "SUCCESS" message, tell me how many seconds it took.

If you don't see the "SUCCESS" message and the app just hangs or shows the 0 count, it confirms the process is timing out.
