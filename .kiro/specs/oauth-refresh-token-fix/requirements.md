# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently experiences authentication failures when making YouTube API calls due to missing refresh tokens in the Google OAuth flow. When access tokens expire (typically after 1 hour), the application cannot automatically refresh them, causing API requests to fail with 401 errors. This feature will implement proper OAuth refresh token handling to ensure continuous API access without requiring users to re-authenticate frequently.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication to persist across sessions without frequent re-login prompts, so that I can use the application seamlessly without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in through Google OAuth THEN the system SHALL request offline access to obtain a refresh token
2. WHEN the OAuth flow completes THEN the system SHALL store both access token and refresh token in the user's database record
3. WHEN a user's session is active THEN the system SHALL maintain authentication without requiring re-login for extended periods
4. IF a user has previously granted offline access THEN the system SHALL prompt for consent again to ensure refresh token is provided

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system, I want to automatically refresh expired access tokens using stored refresh tokens, so that API calls continue to work without user intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an access token expires during an API call THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to refresh it using the stored refresh token
2. WHEN refreshing an access token THEN the system SHALL update the stored credentials with the new access token
3. WHEN a refresh token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and prompt for re-authentication
4. WHEN token refresh succeeds THEN the system SHALL retry the original API request with the new access token

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for authentication failures, so that I can diagnose and resolve OAuth-related issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth credentials are missing required fields THEN the system SHALL log specific error details about which fields are missing
2. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason and initiate re-authentication flow
3. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to help with troubleshooting
4. WHEN credentials are successfully refreshed THEN the system SHALL log the successful refresh for monitoring purposes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle authentication errors gracefully, so that I receive clear feedback when re-authentication is needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automatic token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the login page with an appropriate message
2. WHEN re-authentication is required THEN the system SHALL preserve the user's intended action to resume after login
3. WHEN authentication succeeds after a failure THEN the system SHALL continue with the user's original request
4. WHEN multiple authentication failures occur THEN the system SHALL prevent infinite redirect loops
