# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The YouTube Data API integration in our Python Flask application has a critical bug where the special "Watch Later" playlist (ID: 'WL') consistently returns a video count of 0, even when the playlist contains videos. This affects the user experience by displaying incorrect information about their Watch Later playlist while all other playlists work correctly. The issue has been isolated to the specific code logic handling the Watch Later playlist, as permissions, timeouts, and general API connectivity have been ruled out.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with videos in my Watch Later playlist, I want to see the correct video count displayed in the application, so that I can accurately track how many videos I have saved to watch later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application fetches playlists for a user with videos in their Watch Later playlist THEN the system SHALL display the correct non-zero video count for the Watch Later playlist
2. WHEN the Watch Later playlist is empty THEN the system SHALL display a video count of 0
3. WHEN the Watch Later playlist contains multiple pages of videos THEN the system SHALL correctly count all videos across all pages
4. WHEN the API call to fetch Watch Later playlist items succeeds THEN the system SHALL log the successful count retrieval

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Watch Later playlist to be handled consistently with other playlists, so that the application provides a uniform experience across all playlist types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application displays playlists THEN the Watch Later playlist SHALL appear in the list with other playlists
2. WHEN there is an error accessing the Watch Later playlist THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and display an appropriate error state
3. WHEN the Watch Later playlist is successfully accessed THEN the system SHALL mark it as a special playlist type for proper UI handling
4. IF the Watch Later playlist cannot be accessed due to API errors THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other playlists

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the YouTube API integration to properly handle the unique characteristics of the Watch Later playlist, so that the application works reliably with all YouTube playlist types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls to the Watch Later playlist THEN the system SHALL use the correct API endpoint and parameters specific to this playlist type
2. WHEN processing Watch Later playlist responses THEN the system SHALL handle any unique response format differences compared to regular playlists
3. WHEN pagination is required for the Watch Later playlist THEN the system SHALL correctly iterate through all pages to get the complete count
4. WHEN the API response format differs from regular playlists THEN the system SHALL adapt the parsing logic accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and error handling for the Watch Later playlist functionality, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Watch Later playlist is successfully processed THEN the system SHALL log the video count and processing time
2. WHEN API errors occur during Watch Later playlist processing THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including error codes and messages
3. WHEN the Watch Later playlist processing completes THEN the system SHALL log whether the operation was successful or failed
4. IF debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log additional details about API requests and responses for the Watch Later playlist
