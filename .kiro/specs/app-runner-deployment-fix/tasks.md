# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Clean up codebase and identify unused files




  - Scan the project directory for test files, duplicates, and troubleshooting artifacts
  - Create a list of files to remove vs files to keep
  - Remove identified unused files that are cluttering the codebase
  - _Requirements: Codebase organization and cleanup_

- [x] 2. Fix requirements.txt syntax errors


  - Correct the malformed dependency entries in requirements.txt
  - Ensure all dependencies have proper version specifications
  - Validate that all required packages for the Flask application are included
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Create corrected Docker runtime configuration



  - Fix the apprunner.yaml file to use proper Docker runtime syntax
  - Remove conflicting Python runtime commands from Docker configuration
  - Ensure Dockerfile reference is correct and ports align
  - Test the corrected Docker configuration syntax
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1_

- [x] 4. Update Dockerfile for App Runner compatibility


  - Verify Dockerfile uses correct port configuration for App Runner
  - Ensure CMD instruction properly starts the Flask application
  - Validate that all necessary dependencies are installed in Docker image
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Create Python runtime configuration alternative



  - Generate a Python runtime version of apprunner.yaml
  - Configure proper port 8080 binding for Python runtime approach
  - Set up correct gunicorn command for App Runner Python environment
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.2_

- [x] 6. Test local deployment configurations




  - Test Docker configuration with local docker build and run commands
  - Test Python runtime configuration with local gunicorn commands
  - Verify health check endpoint responds correctly on both configurations
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.3_

- [x] 7. Create deployment documentation


  - Document both Docker and Python runtime deployment approaches
  - Include step-by-step instructions for each configuration method
  - Add troubleshooting guide for common deployment issues
  - Provide clear guidance on choosing between Docker vs Python runtime
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 8. Validate final configuration files



  - Perform final syntax validation on all configuration files
  - Ensure no conflicts between different runtime approaches
  - Verify all file references and paths are correct
  - Test that health check endpoint works with both port configurations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 3.3_
