# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Flask application deployment to AWS App Runner is failing with CREATE_FAILED status due to misconfigured `apprunner.yaml` file. The configuration is mixing Docker runtime syntax with Python runtime commands, causing App Runner to fail during the build and deployment process. This feature will fix the deployment configuration to enable successful App Runner deployments using either the Docker runtime approach or the recommended Python runtime approach.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the App Runner deployment to succeed without CREATE_FAILED errors, so that the Flask application can be accessible via AWS App Runner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the App Runner service is created THEN the deployment SHALL complete successfully without CREATE_FAILED status
2. WHEN using Docker runtime THEN the `apprunner.yaml` SHALL contain only Docker-specific configuration syntax
3. WHEN using Python runtime THEN the `apprunner.yaml` SHALL contain only Python-specific configuration syntax
4. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the Flask application SHALL be accessible via the App Runner service URL

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to choose between Docker and Python runtime approaches, so that I can select the most appropriate deployment method for the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Docker runtime THEN the configuration SHALL reference the existing Dockerfile correctly
2. WHEN using Python runtime THEN the configuration SHALL use App Runner's managed Python environment
3. WHEN using Python runtime THEN a proper `requirements.txt` file SHALL be available with all dependencies
4. IF Python runtime is selected THEN the Dockerfile SHALL be optional and not interfere with the build process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to run on the correct port and respond to health checks, so that App Runner can properly manage the service lifecycle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Docker runtime THEN the application SHALL run on port 8000 as specified in the Dockerfile
2. WHEN using Python runtime THEN the application SHALL run on port 8080 as per App Runner convention
3. WHEN App Runner performs health checks THEN the `/health` endpoint SHALL respond with HTTP 200 status
4. WHEN the service starts THEN the gunicorn server SHALL bind to the correct host and port configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of both deployment approaches, so that I can understand the differences and make informed decisions about which approach to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing deployment options THEN documentation SHALL clearly explain Docker vs Python runtime trade-offs
2. WHEN following the documentation THEN step-by-step instructions SHALL be provided for both approaches
3. WHEN troubleshooting deployment issues THEN common problems and solutions SHALL be documented
4. IF deployment fails THEN the documentation SHALL include debugging steps and error resolution guidance
