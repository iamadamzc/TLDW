# Proxy Configuration Fix Summary

## üîß Critical Issue Resolved

**Problem:** `proxy_manager.py` was hardcoded to use `'tldw-oxylabs-proxy-config'` instead of the `OXYLABS_PROXY_CONFIG` environment variable configured in App Runner.

**Root Cause:** When switching from repository-sourced to container registry deployment, the proxy manager continued using a hardcoded secret name while App Runner was configured to provide the secret ARN via environment variable.

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. Environment Variable Resolution
- **Before:** `response = client.get_secret_value(SecretId='tldw-oxylabs-proxy-config')`
- **After:** `secret_id = os.getenv('OXYLABS_PROXY_CONFIG', 'tldw-oxylabs-proxy-config')`

### 2. Enhanced Logging & Diagnostics
- Added secret type detection (ARN vs name)
- Added masked username logging for troubleshooting
- Enhanced error messages for different AWS error types
- Added proxy health info for `/healthz` endpoint

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Specific handling for `ResourceNotFoundException` (secret not found)
- Specific handling for `AccessDenied` (IAM permission issues)
- Clear logging of which secret reference is being used

## üéØ Expected Impact

### Fixes These Production Issues:
1. **407 Proxy Authentication Required** - Now uses correct secret with valid credentials
2. **Intermittent proxy failures** - Consistent secret source eliminates credential mismatches
3. **"Failed to extract player response"** - Proper proxy authentication prevents fallback to direct requests
4. **Bot detection errors** - Authenticated proxy requests are less likely to trigger bot defenses

### Improves Observability:
- `/healthz` endpoint now shows proxy configuration status
- Logs include masked username prefix for troubleshooting
- Clear indication of whether ARN or name is being used
- Better error messages for IAM and secret access issues

## üîç How to Verify the Fix

### 1. Check Logs After Deployment
Look for these log messages:
```
Loading proxy config from arn: arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:528131355234:secret:tldw-oxylabs-proxy-config-mkbzlM
Loaded proxy config - secret_type: arn, username: user***, geo_enabled: true, country: us
```

### 2. Check Health Endpoint
`GET /healthz` should now include:
```json
{
  "proxy_config": {
    "enabled": true,
    "status": "configured",
    "has_username": true,
    "has_password": true,
    "username_prefix": "user***",
    "geo_enabled": true,
    "country": "us"
  }
}
```

### 3. Monitor for 407 Errors
- Should see significant reduction in "407 Proxy Authentication Required" errors
- Should see fewer "Failed to extract player response" errors
- Should see improved success rates for both transcript and ASR paths

## üöÄ Deployment Configuration

The fix works with your existing App Runner configuration:

```json
"RuntimeEnvironmentSecrets": {
  "OXYLABS_PROXY_CONFIG": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:528131355234:secret:tldw-oxylabs-proxy-config-mkbzlM"
}
```

No deployment configuration changes needed - the code now correctly uses the environment variable.

## üß™ Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_proxy_config_fix.py` covering:
- Environment variable resolution (ARN vs name)
- Username masking for security
- Health info generation without sensitive data exposure
- Integration with ProxyManager class

All tests pass ‚úÖ

## üìä Monitoring Recommendations

After deployment, monitor these metrics:
1. **407 error rate** - should drop significantly
2. **Bot detection rate** - should decrease
3. **ASR fallback rate** - should remain stable or improve
4. **Overall transcript success rate** - should improve

The enhanced logging will make it much easier to troubleshoot any remaining proxy issues.
