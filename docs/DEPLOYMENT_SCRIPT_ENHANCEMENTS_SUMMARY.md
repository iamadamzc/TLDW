# Deployment Script Enhancements - Task 5 Summary

## Overview

Task 5 has been completed successfully. This task focused on enhancing the deployment script with container-based cache busting to ensure proper App Runner service restarts and reliable deployments.

## Implementation Status

‚úÖ **ENHANCED** - The deployment script already had most functionality and has been enhanced with additional rollback capabilities and improved error handling.

## Enhancements Made

### 1. Enhanced Rollback Functionality

**Added Features:**
- `--rollback-to IMAGE_URI` command line option for quick rollbacks
- Automatic rollback instructions when deployment fails
- Previous image URI tracking for rollback reference
- Rollback mode detection and handling

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Command line option
--rollback-to IMAGE_URI    # Rollback to specific image instead of deploying new code

# Automatic rollback instructions on failure
üîÑ ROLLBACK INSTRUCTIONS:
   To rollback to the previous version, run:
   aws apprunner update-service \
     --service-arn "arn:aws:apprunner:..." \
     --region "us-west-2" \
     --source-configuration '{"ImageRepository":{"ImageIdentifier":"previous-image-uri"}}'
```

### 2. Improved Error Handling

**Enhanced Features:**
- Detailed failure reason extraction from AWS App Runner
- Comprehensive troubleshooting steps
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- Failure status detection and handling

**Implementation:**
```bash
"CREATE_FAILED"|"UPDATE_FAILED"|"DELETE_FAILED")
    echo "‚ùå Deployment failed with status: $status"
    
    # Get failure details
    echo "üîç Getting failure details..."
    failure_info=$(aws apprunner describe-service ...)
    
    echo "üí° Troubleshooting steps:"
    echo "   1. Check App Runner service logs in AWS Console"
    echo "   2. Verify the container image exists and is accessible"
    echo "   3. Check environment variables and secrets configuration"
    echo "   4. Ensure the service has proper IAM permissions"
```

### 3. Enhanced Deployment Validation

**Existing + Enhanced Features:**
- Previous image URI tracking for comparison
- Detailed deployment status monitoring
- Health check verification after deployment
- Service URL extraction and testing

## Requirements Verification

All requirements from task 5 are satisfied:

### ‚úÖ Requirement 5.1: Unique Tags and Service Restart
- **Implementation**: Uses `GIT_SHA-TIMESTAMP` for unique container tags
- **Verification**: Calls `aws apprunner update-service` to force restart
- **Test Result**: ‚úÖ Verified

### ‚úÖ Requirement 5.2: New Code Running (Not Cached)
- **Implementation**: Validates `current_image == IMAGE_URI` after deployment
- **Verification**: Compares expected vs actual image URI
- **Test Result**: ‚úÖ Verified

### ‚úÖ Requirement 5.3: Service Restart Validation
- **Implementation**: Checks "Service is running with new image" status
- **Verification**: Monitors deployment progress and validates success
- **Test Result**: ‚úÖ Verified

### ‚úÖ Requirement 5.4: Error Messages and Rollback Instructions
- **Implementation**: Provides detailed error messages and rollback commands
- **Verification**: Shows troubleshooting steps and rollback instructions
- **Test Result**: ‚úÖ Verified

### ‚úÖ Requirement 5.5: Environment Configuration Updates
- **Implementation**: Preserves and updates `RuntimeEnvironmentVariables` and `RuntimeEnvironmentSecrets`
- **Verification**: Extracts current config and applies to new deployment
- **Test Result**: ‚úÖ Verified

## Key Features

### Container-Based Cache Busting
```bash
# Unique container tagging
GIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%s)
IMAGE_TAG="${GIT_SHA}-${TIMESTAMP}"

# Build with cache buster
docker build --build-arg CACHE_BUSTER="${IMAGE_TAG}" -t "${ECR_REPOSITORY}:${IMAGE_TAG}" .
```

### Deployment Validation
```bash
# Validate new image is running
if [[ "$current_image" == "$IMAGE_URI" ]]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Service is running with new image: $IMAGE_URI"
else
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Service running but with different image:"
    echo "   Current: $current_image"
    echo "   Expected: $IMAGE_URI"
fi
```

### Environment Preservation
```bash
# Extract and preserve current configuration
ENV_VARS=$(echo "$CURRENT_CONFIG" | jq -c '.Service.SourceConfiguration.ImageRepository.ImageConfiguration.RuntimeEnvironmentVariables // {}')
SECRETS=$(echo "$CURRENT_CONFIG" | jq -c '.Service.SourceConfiguration.ImageRepository.ImageConfiguration.RuntimeEnvironmentSecrets // {}')
```

### Rollback Support
```bash
# Rollback mode
if [[ -n "$ROLLBACK_TO" ]]; then
    echo "üîÑ ROLLBACK MODE: Rolling back to image: ${ROLLBACK_TO}"
    IMAGE_URI="$ROLLBACK_TO"
    # Skip build and push for rollback
fi
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suites to verify the enhancements:

### Test Files Created
1. **`test_deployment_script_enhanced.py`** - Comprehensive functionality tests
2. **`test_deployment_simple.py`** - Simple verification tests
3. **`DEPLOYMENT_SCRIPT_ENHANCEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary

### Test Results
```
üß™ Testing Enhanced Deployment Script
========================================

‚úÖ Container-based cache busting with unique tags
‚úÖ AWS App Runner service restart enforcement  
‚úÖ Deployment validation and verification
‚úÖ Rollback functionality and instructions
‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling and troubleshooting
‚úÖ Environment variable and secrets preservation
‚úÖ All requirements 5.1-5.5 compliance

```

## Usage Examples

### Normal Deployment
```bash
./deploy-apprunner.sh
```

### Dry Run
```bash
./deploy-apprunner.sh --dry-run
```

### Rollback to Previous Version
```bash
./deploy-apprunner.sh --rollback-to "123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tldw:abc123-1640995200"
```

### Custom Timeout
```bash
./deploy-apprunner.sh --timeout 900
```

3. **Clear Diagnostics**: Comprehensive error messages and troubleshooting guidance
4. **Configuration Safety**: Preserves environment variables and secrets during updates
5. **Deployment Validation**: Verifies that new code is actually running after deployment
6. **Operational Excellence**: Detailed logging and status monitoring throughout the process
