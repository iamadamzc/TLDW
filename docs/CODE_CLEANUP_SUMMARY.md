# Code Cleanup and Environment Variable Standardization Summary

## Overview

Task 8 has been completed successfully. This task focused on eliminating code duplications and standardizing environment variable names for Google OAuth configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Code Duplications in TranscriptService

**Problem**: TranscriptService was duplicating initialization of ProxyManager, ProxyHTTPClient, and UserAgentManager.

**Solution**: 
- Simplified TranscriptService.__init__ to use shared managers by default
- Removed duplicate `_create_proxy_manager` method from TranscriptService
- All manager initialization now goes through SharedManagers singleton

**Files Modified**:
- `transcript_service.py`: Removed duplicate initialization code and `_create_proxy_manager` method

### 2. Standardized Google OAuth Environment Variables

**Problem**: Inconsistent naming between `GOOGLE_CLIENT_*` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_*` across the codebase.

**Solution**:
- Standardized on `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` as the primary variable names
- Added backwards compatibility to support legacy `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_*` variables
- Updated deployment scripts to use consistent naming

**Files Modified**:
- `google_auth.py`: Added backwards compatibility fallback logic
- `deploy-apprunner.sh`: Fixed environment variable migration logic
- `deploy.sh`: Updated to use standardized variable names

### 3. Created Migration Infrastructure

**New Files Created**:
- `deployment/migrate-env-vars.sh`: Migration script for deployment rollout
- `test_env_vars_simple.py`: Test suite to verify changes
- `CODE_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`: This summary document

## Backwards Compatibility

All changes maintain full backwards compatibility:

1. **Environment Variables**: Code checks for new variables first, then falls back to legacy names
2. **API Interfaces**: No changes to public method signatures
3. **Shared Managers**: TranscriptService can still be initialized with `use_shared_managers=False` if needed

## Migration Strategy

### For Deployment

1. **Immediate**: Use the migration script during rollout:
   ```bash
   source deployment/migrate-env-vars.sh
   ```

2. **Long-term**: Update AWS Secrets Manager and environment configurations to use standardized names:
   - `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` → `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
   - `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` → `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

### Environment Variable Precedence

The code now follows this precedence order:
1. `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (new standard)
2. `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` (legacy fallback)
3. Default value (for development)

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite that verifies:
- ✅ Migration script exists and has correct content
- ✅ SharedManagers singleton pattern works correctly
- ✅ TranscriptService uses shared managers (no duplication)
- ✅ google_auth.py has proper backwards compatibility
- ✅ Deployment scripts have consistent variable usage

All tests pass successfully.

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Memory Usage**: Eliminates duplicate manager instances
2. **Consistent Configuration**: Standardized environment variable naming
3. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for manager initialization
4. **Deployment Safety**: Backwards compatibility ensures zero-downtime rollout
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear migration path and consistent naming

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies all requirements from task 8:

- ✅ **6.1**: Removed duplicate initialization of ProxyManager, ProxyHTTPClient, and UserAgentManager in TranscriptService
- ✅ **6.2**: Standardized Google OAuth environment variable names between GOOGLE_CLIENT_* and GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_*
- ✅ **6.3**: Added one-time migration map in deploy script for old→new variable mapping during rollout
- ✅ **6.4**: Updated deployment scripts and App Runner configuration to use consistent variable names
- ✅ **6.5**: Ensured google_auth.py code matches the environment variable names used in deployment

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Use the migration script during the next deployment
2. **Monitor**: Verify that OAuth integration works with both old and new variable names
3. **Migrate Secrets**: Update AWS Secrets Manager to use standardized variable names
4. **Clean Up**: After successful migration, legacy variable support can be removed in a future release

## Files Changed
