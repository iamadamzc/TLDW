## Problems Solved

### üö® Critical Production Issues Fixed

#### 1. ProxyManager Startup Crashes
- **Problem**: Service crashed on startup due to missing "provider" field in AWS Secrets Manager
- **Solution**: Graceful degradation with `in_use=False` when secrets are malformed
- **Impact**: Service now starts reliably even with configuration issues

#### 2. yt-dlp Extraction Failures
- **Problem**: "Failed to extract any player response" errors causing download failures
- **Solution**: Multi-client support with ["android", "web", "web_safari"] and network resilience
- **Impact**: Significantly reduced extraction failures and improved reliability

#### 3. Deployment Cache Issues
- **Problem**: App Runner deployments not picking up new code due to caching
- **Solution**: Container-based cache busting with unique image tags
- **Impact**: Deployments now reliably deploy new code

#### 4. Missing Observability
- **Problem**: No visibility into production issues for debugging
- **Solution**: Comprehensive health endpoints with gated diagnostics
- **Impact**: Full system observability for monitoring and debugging

#### 5. Code Duplication and Inconsistency
- **Problem**: Duplicate manager initialization and inconsistent environment variables
- **Solution**: SharedManagers singleton and standardized variable naming
- **Impact**: Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

## Implementation Highlights

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### Enhanced Error Handling
- **Error Message Combination**: Step1 and step2 errors combined with " || " separator
- **Bot Detection**: Enhanced patterns for combined error messages
- **Length Capping**: 10k character limit to prevent jumbo log lines
- **Structured Logging**: Normalized error strings for monitoring systems

#### Robust Health Monitoring
- **Gated Diagnostics**: `EXPOSE_HEALTH_DIAGNOSTICS` flag for production security
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: yt-dlp version, ffmpeg status, proxy health, download metadata
- **Privacy-Safe**: No sensitive information exposed in health endpoints
- **Monitoring Ready**: Structured data for Grafana/Kibana integration

#### Cookie Management & Tracking
- **Freshness Logging**: 12-hour staleness detection with warnings
- **Download Tracking**: Comprehensive metadata without PII exposure
- **Health Integration**: Success rates and attempt tracking
- **Privacy-First**: Only safe metadata exposed, no cookie contents or file paths

#### CI/CD & Testing
- **Fixture-Based Testing**: No external dependencies for reliable CI
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: End-to-end, ASR path, cookie scenarios
- **Regression Prevention**: Backwards compatibility validation
- **Production-Ready**: Smoke tests prevent deployment of broken code

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy Enhancements

#### Data Protection
- **No PII Exposure**: Video IDs sanitized, user data protected
- **Safe Logging**: Cookie contents never logged, only metadata
- **Credential Masking**: Proxy usernames masked in logs
- **Path Protection**: Only filenames exposed, never full paths

#### Production Security
- **Gated Diagnostics**: Detailed health info only when explicitly enabled
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues working when components fail
- **Error Sanitization**: Sensitive information removed from error messages
- **Access Control**: Health endpoints don't leak configuration details
